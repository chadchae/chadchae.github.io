I cultivate a high standard of research ethics and maintain a keen sense of the nature of phenomena. I appreciate the necessarily diligent manner in collaboration that enhances productivity and the performance of sustainable research activity. I adopt both qualitative and quantitative research approaches.\nCurrently, my research focuses on the following three areas: (1) knowledge structures and sharing practices; (2) career, talent, and professional development related to a virtual and technology-centered workforce; and (3) social capital and network analysis in learning and organization development contexts. I am interested in knowledge sharing patterns that would reflect national and organizational cultures, and its antecedents and consequences in the organizational setting. Using a multi-group latent class analysis and structural equation modeling, my dissertation examines what is the nationally specified knowledge-sharing pattern with regard to social capital and intentions for knowledge sharing. It examines the antecedents of this knowledge-sharing pattern and consequences of knowledge-sharing patterns for organizational effectiveness. Also, my current research examines issues of career, talent, and professional development regarding the virtual and technology centered workforce. In a current paper under publication revision, I examined the impact of technology and team success factors in a virtual team setting. Based on the rich context of interview and themes that we covered, the project made a guideline for successful virtual team processes. I am also interested in studying social capital and network analysis in learning and organization development contexts, the impact of which remains largely neglected in HRD literature. One of my empirical research projects on social capital and collaboration in academic community examines this issue, recognized by the Academy of Human Resource Development with a “Cutting Edge Award in 2015” I remain engaged in social network analysis studies, such as Korean mid- and high tech industries’ structural characteristics, and social capital as antecedents of knowledge sharing, using stochastic and statistical social network analysis, multiple regression with quadric assignment procedure (MRQAP).\nAlong with these research interests, I pursue data and analytics driven approaches that require understanding of various technology and data analysis skills. I have expert understanding in data analysis using R (statistics software package), Tableau (interactive data visualization), NVIVO (qualitative data management and analysis software), Netminer, UCINET (social network analysis), and Vensim (system dynamics and thinking). Regarding my expertise in method and data analysis, I was invited to the Korean R user group to deliver a professional presentation about the stochastic approach of social network analysis in R. Recently, ECCI university at Bogota, Columbia invited me to deliver a professional workshop for social network analysis in R.\nMy research philosophy has governed my research activities that lead me to be a successful team worker in research practice, and it enables me to discover meaningful and new knowledge that I am proud to contribute to within academic communities and professional practices. Given the change of social phenomena in the workplace and the rapid growth of methodology, these changes require me keep searching for new opportunities to develop my research skills.\nTeaching Statement\nMy teaching experience began by teaching underprivileged students in a re-development zone of the Pyung-tak, Kyungi-do province in Korea. As an undergraduate student, and after graduation, I served as a tutor for adult learners who had given up their studies to support their family. This experience shaped my understanding of teaching to be a continual process of mutual understanding between a learner and an instructor. As such, teaching is not merely the delivery of knowledge, it is a facilitation of learners to achieve knowledge acquisition. As a teacher, my focus is on the configuration of the learner, context, and learning process. I strive to engage, challenge and inspire growth in my students. In the university setting, I believe college students, as adult learners, possess the abilities to apprehend knowledge and skills, but often they are circumscribed to comprehend. It is my aim, then, to create a successful student learning experience in which students gain an understanding of the basic concepts and knowledge sets, and to apply them to formulate questions, critique literature, and design studies to address their questions.\nMoreover, my role as a teacher is to facilitate comprehension, critical thinking, and practical experiences. I recognize that sharing my background often sparks students’ interest in the real-world applicability of theories learned in the classroom. I encourage students to regard workforce education and human resource development as a very effective discipline and best learned through interactive and immersive contexts. For example, I prefer to teach by constructing new knowledge as a result of reflection. These reflections enable me to gauge which concepts students are struggling with and which parts I could expect more critical thinking from students. As Knowles (1980) realized, teachers need to connect their content with the professional or personal experiences of adult learners for learning effectiveness. When beginning a learning facilitation session, I meet every student and start developing personal relationships that link students’ lives with the course. This approach encourages students to be open, inclusive, and share their experiences with the class. I believe that all students are valuable resources with a capacity to become collaborators in the exploration of theory, research, and practice. For this reason, it is crucial to challenge them to share information with others. To facilitate collaborative learning, I encourage brainstorming sessions, group projects, and group presentations. My goal is for students to tell me that they left the classroom, truly knowing what it means to be a collaborator. I encourage students to share diverse ideas, and I am straightforward about not having all of the answers but confident that we may all learn together.\nMoreover, I initiate various ways to acquire student feedback during the period of teaching or training so I can calibrate my teaching method based on student needs and desires, along with this feedback, I will continue to grow as an educator. I emphasize the importance of a strong dedication to the profession and the hard work that it entails. I continue to share with students my excitement for learning and the lessons of my professional experiences. I strive to be a thoughtful teacher and mutual learner, and I believe that this is a continuing process.\n\n\n\n",
